\chapter{Planning}
The smart home model box's development and planning began during Project Laboratory and has continued since then with some variations, including the replacement of software platform. This chapter takes a look at the planning phase, before the plans were put into practice.

\section{General goals, requirements and principals of the planned model}
The box project's goal was to get familiar with the most important IoT and related technologies, such as microcontrollers, networking and electronics control and to put this knowledge into practice via the creation of a smart home model system demo box, which can then be used to gain experience with the usage of such a system. 



During the box model project's planning and implementation, gaining experience in the usage IoT technologies at a deeper level and building a smart house solution from inexpensive, easy-to-obtain generic electronic components and open-source software were favored over expensive, locked down out-of-the box solutions as they are tuned for a quick and optimal end-user experience and hide the implementation details from their users, therefore are less suitable for the project.

cost effectiveness
usage of open source software already available, modular, extensible
self hosted

\section{Hardware environment}
The box containing the project's internals was chosen to be a shoebox, which I already had at hand and and is large enough to have separated rooms and smaller electric and electronic components inside it, but also the perfect size to be able to easily portable for transportation between places.
- shoebox - small but decent platform, from material already at hand
floorplan
portable enough
can contain electronics in a human size

- hardware - esp is cheap, the other are basic electronics, reusable later
mention arduino as well

LEDs, cables, resistors, transistors, ldr, servo, peltier, 

- networking - tp link soho router at hand, esp supports wifi, extra wifi adapter
\section{Software environment}
- software - homeassistant, esphome: popular open source projects, good community support, many features
other projects?

- - easy to set up

- - yaml files
