\chapter{Review}

This chapter mainly focuses on the box model's evalution to the requirements specified during the planning phase, shortcomings, how these could potentially be overcome and finally, opportunities of further development.

\section{Usage}

During usage, controlling the model box's components via the user interface is quite impressive, as when components are toggled and values are altered from a laptop or smartphone, the changes made propagate really fast to the model, in a few seconds at most. Besides control, monitoring of the implemented sensors is also reliable, as when influenced externally eg. with more or less heat, light, the change can be seen in the readings of sensors. These values, along with other metrics, actions taken by the user are logged and this history can be reviewed later, or even be plotted to a graph in case of quantifiable amounts between certain time ranges.

The use cases of the model include the most important aspects of a typical smart home environment: monitoring of temperature and light levels, control of basic utilities in the form of heating and cooling, and lastly, a "smartified" rolling shutter (that would be actuated by hand in a conventional home).

\section{Critical analysis, shortcomings}

The experience of using the model box and its user interface is really similar to what a deployed home environment would be, therefore an adequate way to simulate a real smart home system with limitations. The model features a full-fledged smart home software platform, which is used in many installations worldwide. 

main differences to a proper home environment
xyz not added due to the limited scope of the project
limitations of the model

more devices, especially microcontrollers - would have been more expensive, but might be reasonable in a home environment

why self hosted better than having it in the cloud - but needs it sysadm knowledge, ups

requires dev laptop - can be substituted with rpi, server computer...

security vulnerabilities

vendor lock-in - not in this project, but changing platforms can be time consuming

\section{Opportunities of further development}

more automations, devices

set it up in a real house

add energy, security systems

use z-wave, zigbee, matter devices

develop software, hardware for it as a business

protocol development, iot opportunities

business potential
